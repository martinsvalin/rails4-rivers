  <header>Digital tools for PR pros that will transform your working day</header>
  <summary>Katie Moffat, an Online PR and social media specialist, presents the top digital tools to make your working life easier and more efficient. </summary>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;Online PR &amp;amp; social media specialist Katie Moffat was one of the presenters at Mynewsdesk’s first ever "Digitally Fit" breakfast seminar last week. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Katie, there are two major challenges that all PR and comms professionals have to face daily; having too much to do and dealing with information overload. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie has compiled a selection of tools which she would recommend to help you keep up to date with what’s important without taking too much time out of your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.56.55-e1375264786291.png"&gt;&lt;img title="list" src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.56.55-e1375264786291.png" alt="list" width="100%" height="100%" data-mce-src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.56.55-e1375264786291.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Curation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie said that “as PR and comms professionals it’s your job to to keep bang up to date on the key bloggers and the latest stories relevant to your clients and your industry. Not only that, it can provide inspiration for your campaigns as well as helping you to monitor your competitors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unless you have a lot of time on your hands there is nothing worse than sifting through endless streams of poorly written, useless content. &amp;nbsp;This is where the following tools come in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Feedly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="www.feedly.com" target="_blank"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; allows you to compile news feeds from various online sources including websites, blogs and RSS feeds. As you add new content you can separate it into relevant categories, keeping each theme or topic of interest together. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you share the login details with your colleagues it can become a really useful resource for the whole team to keep on top of the latest news from various sources.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Zite&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zite.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Zite&lt;/a&gt; is an app for iPhone and tablet which essentially creates your own personalised, interactive magazine based on your social communities, likes and interests. The more you use it, the more it understands what content you’re interested in. Furthermore, the articles it chooses are made up of the most popularly read and shared so you know it’s all killer and no filler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A top tip is to remember to plug in your twitter account. This gives the app more info about your likes and influences as well as giving you the opportunity to directly tweet the articles from your twitter account. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pinboard&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="pinboard.in" target="_blank"&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; is very simple. It's a private tool that allows you to curate all of your content, add a description of the piece to remind you and tag each article so it is easily organised and searchable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will eventually build up a library of interesting material which you can refer back to when writing blogs, presentations or trying to find inspiration for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-11.34.35-e1375266927857.png"&gt;&lt;img title="curation" src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-11.34.35-e1375266927857.png" alt="curation" width="100%" height="100%" data-mce-src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-11.34.35-e1375266927857.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Working harder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;With all the apps available, it's hard to keep track of them all. However, there are some apps which help you to work harder but more importantly apps which makes your digital tools work harder for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;IFTTT - (If this then that)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ifttt.com" target="_blank"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool which allows you to work across your various social media channels and digital tools. You can set up a “recipe” which means when you do something in one account it will then follow your instructions and trigger something to happen in another account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you take a picture with instagram IFTTT will automatically trigger the downloading of this image into your drop box. Or say, if you favourite something in your RSS then it will automatically send a copy to your Instapaper account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, you set IFTTT up the way in which it will save you time and improve your own working practices. You are free to choose from the recipes which will benefit you the most or create your own to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.56.26-e1375265238546.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Procrastination" src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.56.26-e1375265238546.png" alt="Procrastination" width="100%" height="100%" data-mce-src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.56.26-e1375265238546.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Pomodoro Technique and Focus Booster&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The miracle cure to end your procrastination is....a tomato. Inspired by his tomato shaped cooking timer, Francesco Cirillo came up with the &lt;a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Pomodoro Technique&lt;/a&gt;, a time management method of breaking down the periods in which you work to 25 mins and separated by short breaks. This method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.focusboosterapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Focus Booster&lt;/a&gt; is a countdown timer app for your phone developed to help you follow the Pomodoro Technique.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.58.06-e1375264877617.png"&gt;&lt;img title="The Pomodoro Technique" src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.58.06-e1375264877617.png" alt="The Pomodoro Technique" width="100%" height="100%" data-mce-src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.58.06-e1375264877617.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist" target="_blank"&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt; is an app which allows you to create multiple to-do lists which can also be synched across multiple devices. &amp;nbsp;The free version of this app is great for personal use, however, on the pro account you can use it as part of a team to collaborate on tasks and assign each other tasks to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;u&gt;Managing Twitter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many organisations Twitter is the social media platform of choice. There are several apps which can help you to schedule tweets, create lists, monitor your influencers and analyse your effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tweetdeck.com/" target="_blank"&gt;TweetDeck&lt;/a&gt; allows you to arrange your feeds, schedule your tweets and monitor and manage more than one account. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="hootsuite.com" target="_blank"&gt;Hootsuite&lt;/a&gt; is similar to this but you can also add other social media channels including Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-11.24.12-e1375266418620.png"&gt;&lt;img title="twitter tools" src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-11.24.12-e1375266418620.png" alt="twitter tools" width="100%" height="100%" data-mce-src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-11.24.12-e1375266418620.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.socialbro.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SocialBro&lt;/a&gt; is a little different. It allows you to create powerful insights into your audience including their interests and interactions. It has tools which work out the optimal times for you to tweet, and keep track of your influencers as well as tools to help you focus on your target audience of clients, customers and influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://manageflitter.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Manage Flitter&lt;/a&gt; is another application which can really help you to manage your twitter account. Did you know that you have to exceed 2,000 followers before you yourself can follow more than 2,000 accounts? Manage Flitter tells you who you have followed but have not followed you back, those that have been inactive for long periods of time, those who are spam accounts etc, allowing you to clear out those that are not important or useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Edgerank Checker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Katie, &lt;a href="http://edgerankchecker.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Edgerank Checker&lt;/a&gt; is the only tool you need to help you with Facebook. Edgerank is the algorithm which Facebook uses to determine where your posts will show up on users’ news feeds. &amp;nbsp;Edgerank Checker will give you insights into how to improve your posts to better reach your target audience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.57.32.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Facebook Edgerank" src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.57.32.png" alt="Facebook Edgerank" width="100%" height="100%" data-mce-src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.57.32.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mynewsdesk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final tool was our very own &lt;a href="http://www.mynewsdesk.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mynewsdesk&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;We're&amp;nbsp;the world’s leading all-in-one brand newsroom and multimedia PR platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're in our newsroom right now so take a look around and let us know what you think.

  <header>An interview with Jon Morter, a social media pioneer and campaigner.</header>
  <summary>Jon Morter is a Rock DJ turned social media pioneer and campaigner.  With his wife Tracey, they have created some of the most well known social media campaigns including the likes of the Rage Against the Machine for Christmas No.1 and the campaign to save BBC 6.

  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Morter" target="_blank"&gt;Jon Morter&lt;/a&gt; is a Rock DJ turned social media pioneer and campaigner. &amp;nbsp;With his wife Tracey, they have created some of the most well known social media campaigns including the likes of the &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/dec/20/rage-against-machine-christmas-number-1" target="_blank"&gt;Rage Against the Machine for Christmas No.1&lt;/a&gt; and the campaign to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/saved6music/" target="_blank"&gt;save BBC 6&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;He now runs the social media company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Big_Other" target="_blank"&gt;Big Other&lt;/a&gt; with Jamie Turner.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. You began your career as a Rock DJ and you’re now an award winning ‘social media campaigner,’ how did this change come about? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do still DJ a little when I can, but yes when I started out as a Rock DJ I had no aspirations of ever being a campaigner as such, plus online didn’t really exist back then. I first started to use ‘social media’ (a term I’m a little uncomfortable with but there’s no real alternative) around 2001 (i think) with Friends Reunited and marvelled at its possibilities. A year later John Otway managed to score a top 10 hit single by using an e-mail campaign, something that I was involved with as a fan but it certainly lodged itself in my head...again how effective online could be if utilised in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook was what really showed me how powerful social media could be. I played around with it in my spare time and experimented with the effectiveness of pages and groups. I really saw first hand it’s potential and was determined to exploit it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Why do you think your #80s tweets and your Rage Against the Machine campaigns were so successful? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well #80sTweets was let’s say a well-timed fluke (if that term exists!). One Monday morning on my way into work I stopped off at Pret in London Bridge to grab a coffee. Whilst I was waiting in the queue I checked out my Twitter on the phone and it struck me that I was finding out all of the current affairs and news before even getting into work. It was all very immediate, and I thought to myself how Twitter would have looked in a past time, so I tweeted some very ‘old’ news for the sake of it and made an #80sTweets tag without thinking much more of it. To cut a story short by that Friday afternoon #80sTweets was trending No.1 in the world and had even surpassed #ff &amp;amp; #followfriday. This wasn’t planned at all, but really showed me how one small idea can escalate!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY was it successful? I’m not sure to be honest, but maybe it resonated at the time with many as being quirky (this was early 2009 so not as many ‘joke’ or parody accounts just yet)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rage was successful by being a simple campaign with a very clear goal and me ensuring as many people as possible knew this. If it’s too complex then many people will switch off, that’s just human nature in my opinion, so essentially I was saying ‘If you do this, at this time, then THIS will happen’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Would you say that your social media campaigns were used to defend something you feel strongly about? &amp;nbsp;Do you think this would have been possible without social media?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes absolutely, many of my campaigns have occurred because I’ve ended up getting pissed off about something! Social Media has played a vital role in that for sure although I tend not to get involved in other campaigns that I don’t feel strongly about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Your Rage Against the Machine campaign was a lot more successful than it’s predecessor, the one for the Rick Astley song, why do you think this was? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistakes. They’re brilliant, and I made plenty of them with the Rick Astley campaign. Keep in mind that the Astley ‘RickRoll’ campaign was created by me very much off the cuff with just 3 weeks until the Christmas chart rundown, so I left myself a big mountain to climb with pretty much zero experience of that type of campaign. I hadn’t read the chart rules at all...I hadn’t properly understood the functionality of Facebook groups...in fact in general I had presumed too much, and lo and behold it failed. The following year however was a different animal altogether. I knew the rules, so I knew how far I could bend them without snapping plus another year of experience with Facebook and Twitter too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other thing...I didn’t panic. We had many occasions during the Rage campaign where it all could’ve imploded. One huge example is the entire group being pulled from Facebook, and I suspected foul play from elsewhere (there was a certain element that were trying to “derail” the campaign and I could prove it at the time). Rather than panic I managed to find a contact at Facebook for it to be restored...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Your BBC 6 campaign seemed to be very complicated as a result of other people setting up their own accounts to save BBC 6 too. &amp;nbsp;How did you deal with this?&lt;i&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes the 6Music campaign was a whole new ball game when it came to digital campaigns. The Facebook group in which myself and Tracy were admins was started early and grew very quickly indeed (180,000 in a matter of weeks). We were told very clearly from a few of those inside the BBC that it was imperative for as many people as possible to write to the BBC Trust with their concerns. Simply shouting about it wasn’t going to be enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the campaign grew bigger more and more people created websites, other pages, Twitter accounts, arranged protests, and many other outlets. Unlike the Rage campaign where it was pretty much me running the show (a few people made websites and I asked them to pull them), the 6Music campaign had numerous people ‘doing their bit’. We didn’t really get too involved in what others were doing as we just wanted to concentrate on getting everyone to write to the BBC Trust. I even worked with 38 Degrees to create an ‘easy’ template for people to send. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the positive decision was made public I was asked to speak on Sky News that evening whilst some of the others involved spoke on other channels. It was never ‘our’ campaign as such...we just ran the biggest online outlet for it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. What other social media or digital marketing campaigns have you been involved in?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after the Rage campaign I was invited to work on an official campaign for the Rolling Stones re-release of their Exile On Main St. album. It was an honour to work with such legends and was a thrill to see it hit the No.1 album slot soon after. Nirvana, Sex Pistols, Rod Stewart campaigns have all followed which has been a delight considering I’m a fan of all three!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year I worked the social media campaign for ‘The Justice Collective’ Hillsborough tribute single which was also a privilege to be involved with. This was successful in becoming the 2012 Christmas No.1 and raising legal funds for the families of the Hillsborough victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Which has been your favourite and why? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a tricky one! If I had to pick only one of my campaigns then naturally it would have to be getting Rage Against The Machine to No.1 and breaking a Guinness sales record in the process. I still get days where I think about it in astonishment that we all pulled it off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. What current projects are you working on? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m doing a lot of travelling around right now speaking at numerous functions/conferences/businesses/festivals about my digital antics. I find this very rewarding indeed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project-wise I’m working with a few musicians, a former X Factor contestant *cough cough splutter*, two festivals, and a charity amongst others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. At Digital Shoreditch you presented on condescending social media content. &amp;nbsp;What are your particular social media pet hates? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have all night? In a nutshell I was seeing so much rubbish in my newsfeed from brands I’d previously ‘liked’ spewing out utter childlike drivel. Stuff like ‘What colour are Bananas? Comment below then click Like’. Utter crap. Why on earth treat your fans like they’re 5 years old? I was gradually unliking all of these brands and thought to myself ‘This could really damage a brand’s reputation that they’ve built up over the years in other media, yet potentially wrecked on Facebook’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great example is an online DVD/Games retailer that I used since 1999 yet now I no longer use them. Why? because I’m fed up with their persistent desperate requests for me to click ‘Like’ and ‘Share’. In my eyes that brand has lost my custom due to their annoying social media strategy, simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. &amp;nbsp;Do you have any recent examples of brands using social media badly? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty, just go check out the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/corporatebollocks"&gt;Condescending Corporate Brand Page&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook and take your pick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. What tips do you have for brands or businesses for when they’re using social media? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be yourselves, not what you think you should be according to some self-proclaimed social media ‘expert’ (and there’s thousands of them...some are indeed good but boy are there loads of buzzword-heavy ones spewing. Just type in ‘social media guru’ on Twitter then stand back).&lt;/p&gt;Post good content that’s relevant to who you are. If you’re a company that makes Tractors then if I’ve liked your page I want to see loads of content about Tractors, not ‘What’s your favourite sandwich filling’ or crap like that. &lt;p&gt;You can follow Jon on twitter - &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JonMorter" target="_blank"&gt;@JonMorter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mynewsdesk.com/follow/16854" target=" target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;o receive latest Mynewsdesk stories and updates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <header>How I reached 5,000 followers</header>
  <summary>What does it take to get to 5,000 twitter followers?  Tom Albrighton, founder of ABC Copywriting and co-founder of the Professional Copywriters' Network, explains how he managed to build his network, what he thinks makes good tweets for brands as well as individuals and talks of balancing business and pleasure.
</summary>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When I joined Twitter in 2009, I had no idea what it was for. I’m still not that sure, but I must be doing something right, because over the next three years I managed to rack up 5000 followers. Here are my thoughts on how that might have happened.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may already be thinking something along the lines of ‘Why aim for loads of followers? Surely a relevant, living network is better than an army of spambots?’ That’s true, of course. But at the same time, there’s no escaping the fact that quality does equal quantity on Twitter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful Tweeters are those who consistently create and share quality content, building a large network in the process. Of course, a large following doesn’t necessarily denote quality,&amp;nbsp;just as a small following doesn’t necessarily denote dross. But all else being equal, your follower count is a reflection of how well you’ve played the Twitter game over the course of your Twitter ‘lifetime’.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to get lots of followers is by following lots of people who are likely to follow back. Unfortunately, that tends to be those using Twitter to push their own services (or attempting to). All those followers look good from outside, but inside you’re silently screaming at a feed stuffed with links to products you’ll never buy, blog posts you’ll never read or news you’ve already seen. I firmly believe that there’s no point doing social media you don’t enjoy, so I soon learned to steer clear of the spammers and space-fillers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I will follow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I’ve now developed fairly strict unwritten rules on who I follow back. ‘Talking logo’ company accounts are generally unappealing, unless they’re as funny as @Mangal2. People who post nothing but links are unwelcome too; my problem isn’t finding good stuff to read, but finding the time to read it. Banal oversharers (‘Very tired tonight’…’Having cup of tea’) are right out – but I don’t object to trivia, as long as it’s memorably expressed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t follow everyone back, my follower count hasn’t grown as quickly as it could. People follow me, realise I’m not going to follow them back, and drift away again. But those who are truly intersted do hang around, making slow and steady progress the best way to build a sustainable network in my opinion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, I’ve got a follower:following ratio of around 5:3 (5011 followers, 2850 following). That makes me the sort of person I myself like to follow, and be followed back by. I’m not totally indiscrimate, but I’ll give new people a whirl, and I’m not so up myself that I only deign to follow about 15 people. When I’m followed back by someone like that, it feels like a compliment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Network building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what lessons I can offer to those wanting to use Twitter for business. Almost immediately after joining the site, I realised that most of my key clients and prospects didn’t use Twitter – and those who did weren’t there to find suppliers. But Twitter has still helped my business, just in a very indirect way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of clients, I found myself networking with other copywriters, as well as those from related disciplines like design, web development and marketing in the broadest sense. They shared and commented on my blog posts, which boosted my following further and enhanced my SEO profile. After several years of this, new clients began to mention that they’d enjoyed a post of mine, and it had encouraged them to get in touch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while Twitter is far from being a new-business machine, it does play an important role in the process. When people ask me about using social media commercially, I always speak from my own experience: do what you enjoy, set achievable targets and be realistic about the likely results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brands are often told to inject personality into their social presence. I think they should be themselves, which isn’t quite the same thing. Social tone should be a revelation, not an affectation. Personally, I don't want to see my web developer wittering on about Wimbledon. I want to see them getting into an insanely obscure discussion about Ajax queries. I may not be able to ‘engage’ with it, but it shows they know their stuff and they care about it. If there is a strategic objective to being on Twitter, it’s probably the successful projection of a professional, human but above all genuine personality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Business or pleasure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, I’ve drifted away from a ‘businessy’ approach to Twitter and closer to a more personal approach. My bio used to be a potted cv; now I usually prefer something far shorter and more cryptic (e.g. ‘I can explain’). As well as sending a meta-message about my writing skills, I think this is probably more effective in attracting the sort of followers I’m really interested in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Twitter isn’t LinkedIn. Despite the tiresome ‘Who to follow’ hand-holding, the attraction of the site is discovering who people really are through their words and responses, not who they say they are through an online profile. This in-the-moment edginess is precisely the appeal of the site.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The juxtaposition of business and pleasure can be intoxicating, but it can also be uneasy. I often curb the more trenchant, pessimistic side of my personality because sharing it seems unprofessional. Unlike younger users, I self-censor if I feel people might take offence at my words –&amp;nbsp;through politeness rather than fear. And as a professional writer, I want my feed to reflect a certain level of quality; I don’t want it to be a formless splurge of pointless mood-sharing, me-too reactions to the news or better-left-unsaid drunken replies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my attitude and approach to Twitter have changed a lot, I still use the site obsessively. As a writer, I love the literariness of it – the premium it places on concise and memorable expression. As a solitary home worker, I love being able to hook straight into a massive network of like-minded freelancers at will. And as a human being, I love the incredible variety of personalities, opinions and backgrounds that it presents. Long may it continue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Drake-Brockman was previously responsible for&lt;br&gt;launching new iMedia formats in Australia and has 15 years’ experience running&lt;br&gt;technology events in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ad:tech is timed perfectly to coincide with the fact that marketers will significantly&lt;br&gt;increase their digital spend over the next year and takes place in the context&lt;br&gt;of the rapidly evolving relationship between brands, agencies, media owners and&lt;br&gt;consumers,” said Drake-Brockman. “Our partnership with iMedia Communications&lt;br&gt;and the introduction of the iMedia ethos adds a new dimension to ad:tech,&lt;br&gt;complementing the 7,000 strong audience the show attracts with new&lt;br&gt;opportunities for collaborative learning, exchanging ideas and intimate&lt;br&gt;networking opportunities”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our extensive research with the ad:tech advisory board has allowed us to really get&lt;br&gt;under the skin of the digital marketing community. As a result the educational&lt;br&gt;content at ad:tech this year is positioned to help brands, agencies and media&lt;br&gt;owners solve the key issues they are currently facing. Since announcing our&lt;br&gt;first speakers, the response from potential attendees, exhibitors and sponsors&lt;br&gt;has been exceptional, showing that we are very much on the right track. We’re&lt;br&gt;confident that ad:tech 2013 will set the benchmark for digital events”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For&lt;br&gt;further information and to request a press pass, please contact:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis Richardson t. +44 (020) 3615 0238&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PR and Marketing Assistant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:lewisrichardson@dmgevents.com"&gt;lewisrichardson@dmgevents.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes to Editors:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ad:tech London will take place on 11-12 September at The National Hall, Kensington&lt;br&gt;Olympia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in its ninth year, ad:tech London consists of an exhibition and a conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;b&gt;free&lt;/b&gt; exhibition includes 70+ educational seminars and 150+ exhibitors.

  <header>How Golden Wonder rubbed salt &amp; vinegar into Walkers' wounds</header>
  <summary>Paul Sutton, Head of Social Comms at Bottle PR shared some crispy insights into Golden Wonders' recent PR activity.</summary>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="www.mynewsdesk.com" target="_blank"&gt;Mynewsdesk&lt;/a&gt; recently ran a Q&amp;amp;A with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=" www.twitter.com/thepaulsutton" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Sutton&lt;/a&gt;, Head of Social Comms&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.bottlepr.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;Bottle PR&lt;/a&gt;, who shared some&amp;nbsp;crispy insights&amp;nbsp;into Golden Wonder's recent PR activity. Read the full interview below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you give us a quick overview of the cool work you've been doing with&amp;nbsp;Golden&amp;nbsp;Wonder?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign is based around the colours of crisp packets, and the fact that people associate Cheese &amp;amp; Onion with green and Salt &amp;amp; Vinegar with blue. When we established Golden Wonder’s social media profiles in October, we spent a couple of months monitoring the social web and just listening to what people were saying about ‘crisps’. And it soon became apparent that there was a fair bit of conversation on Twitter, in forums and on Facebook by people fed up and, in some cases outraged, by Walkers’ use of green packs for Salt &amp;amp; Vinegar and blue for Cheese &amp;amp; Onion. Our monitoring highlighted that people feel confused and annoyed at picking up the wrong flavour. Even people like Masterchef supremo Gregg Wallace had voiced their irritation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, we knew that Walkers owns 86% of the flat crisps market and so Golden Wonder is very much a challenger brand. In our favour was that, despite this, Golden Wonder is very well known and has lots of brand affection. People remember Golden Wonder from their childhood, and this itself plays into the whole green/blue argument, as people grew up with Golden Wonder Cheese &amp;amp; Onion in green bags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aggressive tactics...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we devised a real challenger brand campaign to tackle the issue head-on and poke a big stick at Walkers. We came up with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.crunch-time.co/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.crunch-time.co/" target="_blank"&gt;an online petition&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;where people can sign up to campaign to get the colour of crisp packs standardised in the recognised colours. As an ultimate goal, if we were to get 100,000 signatures we would have the right to submit the petition for debate in the House of Commons. It’s backed up by heavy social media activity on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/goldenwonderuk" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/goldenwonderuk"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/goldenwonderuk"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/goldenwonderuk" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, a media relations campaign, and some on-the-ground stunts in the form of ‘Crisp Amnesties’ in various cities, where people can swap one packet of Salt &amp;amp; Vinegar or Cheese &amp;amp; Onion in the wrong colours for two packets of Golden Wonder in the right colours. The latter not only spreads brand awareness in key regions, it also encourages user-generated social media buzz and, importantly, gets product into people’s hands. During our first two amnesties we gave out around 3000 bags of crisps!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Agile PR...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underpinning this activity is an ongoing social media programme of quirky and inventive content creation. We have licence to create ‘special edition’ pack designs and strange new flavour suggestions to generate discussion and, wherever possible, we use agile marketing to hijack topical news. This has worked extremely well with the retirements of both Pope Benedict in February, where we published an ‘Ex Benedict’ flavour pack design, and Sir Alex Ferguson this week, where we published a ‘Golden Handshake’ special edition with a free bus pass in every pack. Both were devised, designed and published inside of 45 minutes of the relevant public announcements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.mynewsdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Golden-Wonders-PR-stunt-campaign-with-Bottle-PR-e1368092468241.jpg" height="356" width="550"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the campaign was social media-generated and is digital media-focused, but encompasses elements of media relations and experiential activity. It’s fully integrated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ok, next question: What have you done to amplify the stunts in this campaign?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign is completely integrated, so we’re using both social and traditional media to magnify the impact of the experiential element. The location and date of each Amnesty is pre-promoted through&amp;nbsp;Golden&amp;nbsp;Wonder’s social profiles and pushed to regional media titles and bloggers. On-the-day, we live tweet pictures and updates from the event and, through social media monitoring, respond in real-time to people posting about their experience on Twitter or Instagram, for example. And then post-event, we publish more pictures and video to keep the buzz going until the next event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How many people are involved in delivering this campaign, and what skills are needed?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a core team of four delivering the campaign; one covering off social media and three devoted to the media relations and experiential activity. The skills vary between team members in line with the different activities, but we all complement one another. Some people are great at the organisational and logistical side, some are good on the phone with the media, some provide creativity and others understand social media tone of voice and implementation. As the campaign is wide-ranging, the skill base needs to be too, and that’s where a team approach that plays to people’s strengths pays dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How are you measuring the campaign?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How aren’t we measuring the campaign?! Given&amp;nbsp;Golden&amp;nbsp;Wonder’s market position, the objectives are&amp;nbsp;to reconnect with those who once loved the brand, and to generate noise and conversation about it through buzz generation. So we’re analysing things like total online mentions and sentiment of&amp;nbsp;Golden&amp;nbsp;Wonder using Brandwatch, we’re measuring Facebook analytics and Twitter buzz, we’re monitoring press mentions, and we’re doing more obvious things like tracking the number of people signing the petition and how many bags of crisps we’re giving out at the Crisp Amnesties. Obviously the ultimate goal is to see an uplift in demand and sales for&amp;nbsp;Golden&amp;nbsp;Wonder and increased distribution, but they are a longer-term goals that go beyond this one campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

  <header>Period drama: the inside story of Bodyform's viral campaign of the month</header>

  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Golding of Team Rubber on how Bodyform responded to a Facebook comment by unleashing a viral video sensation in just 8 days.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Rubber Republic our passion is making highly shareable content. We love to make things that are fun, enjoyable, and get people talking, and because of this we have the privilege of working with bolder and more adventurous clients. However, Bodyform were pretty exceptional, and their desire spawned for us a brilliant and fun job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wednesday before last we got a call in the morning from Carat, Bodyform's media agency. A very savvy team there sent us a link to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bodyform/posts/10151186887359324"&gt;Richard Neill's brilliant post on their Facebook wall&lt;/a&gt; (which despite some of the cynicism online, is totally genuine) and explained that they and Bodyform wanted to respond. They clearly loved the post, but wanted to have some fun with Richard in the way they got back to him. They wanted to do something playful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight away, I and two colleagues started bouncing around ways they could respond. Lots of them were funny but when we came to review them 20 minutes later we realised it was very easy to either not answer Richard’s “question” (by making a joke that wasn't a direct response) or to drift into misogyny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an hour&amp;nbsp;we settled&amp;nbsp;on two approaches which avoided these pitfalls, and which we turned into scripts. One was slightly safer (and addressed men) and the other was a first draft of the script you've seen. We fired them off on email and went and had some lunch.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brilliant and brave Marketing Manager at Bodyform surprised us in two ways. Firstly she responded very quickly. And secondly she picked the sharper of the two scripts as her favourite. From that point on things started to move very fast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday three of us at Rubber Republic wrote drafts taking on different bits of feedback. Friday I hired a writer to combine the three and add his own magic dust while I cast the film and our producer frantically called together a crew for a Saturday shoot in Carat's Regents Park offices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole team were on the shoot (Bodyform, Carat and Rubber Republic’s crew) and we agreed a final shooting script round a table, which I then shot with the crew, and the excellent actress Charlotte Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut the film on Sunday in my conservatory and sent it to the client that night.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were minor revisions (we had safer and bolder versions of every line), but in the end we agreed a cut which used the best bits of everything and released it on Tuesday lunchtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So 6 days end to end from our point of view. 8 days from the original post to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpy75q2DDow"&gt;The film&lt;/a&gt; has had 2.8 million views so far (almost a week since release) but the majority came in the first three days. For the first and second 24-hour period it got roughly a million views a day, which is not bad at all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our client has (thankfully) been rewarded for their bravery and we hope this might prompt other companies to be a little more playful with their marketing work.&lt;/p&gt;

  <header>35% of global newsrooms contain out of date information</header>
  <summary>Mynewsdesk benchmark study of the world's top 100 brands finds them failing to provide influencers with what they need</summary>
  <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;London, 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2013:
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mynewsdesk.com/"&gt;Mynewsdesk&lt;/a&gt; has released a report looking at how the world’s top 100
brands are using online newsrooms. It found that while many companies are
delivering a positive newsroom experience, there are areas for improvement
with, for example, 35% of newsrooms containing information (such as executive
bios, annual reports, fact sheets and product listings) that was out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content
being shared by brands showed a clear bias towards traditional media and
journalists, with many often ignoring the needs of broader online influencers
such as bloggers. On average, brands posted 11 stories to their newsroom each
month but only 21% used it to offer added value content such as blogs, related
industry news, tips and advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
Mynewsdesk benchmark study – &lt;strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;What’s the Story?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – is available for download &lt;a href="http://pages.mynewsdesk.com/The-2013-Newsroom-Report-how-the-worlds-top-100-brands-are-using-online-newsrooms-to-tell-their-stories.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It took the top 100 global brands (as identified in Millward Brown’s&lt;i&gt; 2012 Brandz Top 100&lt;/i&gt;) and benchmarked
them against a set of criteria looking across seven categories including
content, social media and contact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola
(79%) and Siemens (72%) topped the ranking, but elsewhere scores were mixed.
Despite 98% of brands surveyed having a newsroom, the average score was 38%
suggesting that, while some brands were hitting the mark in some areas, there
is still a substantial amount of work needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting in touch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;One of the areas where brands fell down was when it came to
providing effective contact details for visitors with 26% failing to do this
and
45% leaving out contact details on press releases. The option to sign up for
company updates was often lacking, with 70% of newsrooms failing to include any
sort of email alerts. Locating information was generally difficult too, with 39% not including a search function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pictures tell a story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Brands also overlooked
the importance of multimedia content, with 40% failing to provide even the most
basic of image libraries and only 51% featuring video. Where image libraries did
exist, they were often poorly stocked and limited in variety, with images of
employees and customers only featuring in 44% of them.&amp;nbsp; Nearly half (49%) of brands failed to meet
the minimum image or video quality level required for publication. Similarly,
71% failed to embed multimedia within news stories. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“A
newsroom is often the first port of call for influencers looking to find out
information about your company,” said &lt;b&gt;Peter
Ingman, CEO at Mynewsdesk&lt;/b&gt;. “Our study shows that, for even some of the
world’s most recognised brands, there is work to be done when it comes to
providing the necessary content and information. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“In
the digitally connected world in which we now live, a newsroom needs to be much
more than just a repository for press releases. Stocking a newsroom with value
added content – from blog posts and opinion pieces to images and video – will
help you tell your brand story in a more engaging and effective way.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The full benchmark report - &lt;i&gt;What’s the Story?&lt;/i&gt; - offers best practice
guidelines and top tips for a successful online newsroom, with practical
information, expert opinions and real-world examples. Download the full report free

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes
to Editors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Based on a
decade of experience developing newsrooms for companies across the world, the
Mynewsdesk team devised a set of best practice criteria, in conjunction with
professionals from across the communications industry. Mynewsdesk then

criteria and assigned each a score, up to a maximum of 58 points. &lt;/p&gt;
